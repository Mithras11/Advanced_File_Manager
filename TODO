TODO:

add click -> migrate to command line tool

order files by extension
order files and dirs alphabetically -> asc/desc
order by size -> show size in logs -> add header -> "filename:  size:"
order by date -> show date in logs -> sim.

add search files by extension -> in current dir
                          -> recursively
                          -> to be used in move_files functionality?

------------
add archiving option -> save to given output dir or in dir to be archived
                     -> exclude nested dirs option
                     -> choose type -> .zip, .rar, .tar

upload archived file to GoogleDrive

------------
show stats (not logged, only in terminal) -> files and dirs count (including recursively)
                                          -> size in total
=====================
